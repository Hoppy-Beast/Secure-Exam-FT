============================
‚úÖ Features Already Implemented:
============================

1. Fullscreen Mode Enforcement
   - Exam attempts to start in fullscreen via `requestFullscreen()`
   - Monitors fullscreen entry and exit events
   - Warns user on exiting fullscreen multiple times
   - Checks if window size meets minimum fullscreen-like thresholds (height ‚â• 90%, width ‚â• 95%)
   - Works on desktop and mobile (detects landscape orientation)

2. Keyboard and Clipboard Blocking
   - Blocks right-click context menu
   - Blocks copy, cut, paste events (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+X, Ctrl+V)
   - Blocks developer tools shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+I/J, F12, Ctrl+U, Ctrl+S)
   - Logs all keyboard violations

3. Multi-Tab Detection
   - Uses `BroadcastChannel` and `localStorage` to detect multiple exam tabs/windows open simultaneously
   - Alerts user and logs multi-tab activity in real-time

4. Focus Monitoring
   - Listens for `visibilitychange`, `blur`, and `focus` events
   - Logs when user switches tabs, minimizes, or loses focus on exam tab

5. Question Time Tracking (Partial)
   - Tracks time spent on each exam question
   - Logs time intervals for analytics (implementation present but could be extended)

6. Gaze Tracking with MediaPipe FaceMesh
   - Uses MediaPipe FaceMesh model to detect iris position and gaze direction
   - Supports webcam or pre-recorded video input for testing
   - Smooths gaze data over a buffer of recent frames for stability
   - Detects gaze direction (center, left, right, up, down, unknown)
   - Logs gaze direction with timestamps and cooldown to avoid duplicate logs
   - Automatically exports gaze and exam logs as JSON after 25 seconds (demo/test)

============================
üìÑ Logging: Structure and Content
============================

The system maintains two main log categories:

{
  "examEvents": {
    "fullscreen": [],          // Fullscreen enter/exit events
    "keyboard": [],            // Keyboard shortcut and clipboard violations
    "multitab": [],            // Multiple tabs detected
    "fullscreenWarnings": [],  // User warnings about fullscreen exit
    "focus": [],               // Tab/window focus and blur events
    "questionTiming": []       // Timing per question events
  },
  "gazeEvents": {
    "cameraAccess": [],        // Camera/video start and access logs
    "gaze": []                 // Gaze direction data (center, left, right, etc.)
  }
}

‚û° Logs are persisted in `localStorage` with expiration (30 seconds TTL)  ( change to 20 min or 30 min as needed )
‚û° Logs are merged and cleaned regularly to remove stale data  
‚û° Logs are saved under keys: `examLogs` and `gazeLogs`

üõ†Ô∏è Changes Made in Code:
============================

- Exam.html
- Code added from line: 284 to 287 ( two library )
- Code added from line: 570 to 622 ( extra code )
- Code added from line: 634 to 640 ( full screen )

- ft-exam.js
- Fullscreen enforcement and warning code 
- Keyboard and clipboard event blocking and logging 
- Multi-tab detection using BroadcastChannel and localStorage 
- Focus and visibility event listeners 
- Question timer initialization and partial logging 


- gazetracker.js
- MediaPipe FaceMesh gaze tracking setup and processing logic
- Automatic JSON export of combined logs after 25 seconds

============================
üìù TODO / Features Left to Implement:
============================

‚ùó Question Randomization  
- Both question order and answer options should be randomized (preferably server-side)

‚ùó IP Address Session Flags  
- Detect multiple active sessions from the same IP  
- Useful for identifying suspicious behavior in local networks

‚ùó Suspend & Submit Functions  
- anysuspendExam() ‚Äì Triggered on major rule violations (e.g., 3x fullscreen exit)
- anyautoSubmitExam() ‚Äì Automatically submits exam on critical events like devtools open

‚ùó Student Guidelines + Consent  
- Display pre-exam disclaimer: ‚ÄúYour activity is being monitored using AI‚Äù
- Mention that multiple violations may lead to exam suspension or auto-submission

‚ùó Alert System  
- Show a message when a student breaks a rule: "Warning! You are under observation."
- Even if tracking isn't real-time via human, perceived monitoring has psychological effect

‚ùó Leaderboard Hide  
- ‡¶™‡¶∞‡ßÄ‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶ö‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶≤‡ßÄ‡¶® ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶ï‡ßã‡¶∞ ‡¶ì ‡¶≤‡¶ø‡¶°‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶¨‡ßã‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶° ‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶á‡¶° ‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶ñ‡¶æ‡•§  

============================
üì¶ Additional Notes:
============================

- The code demonstrates client-side proctoring using a mix of browser APIs and ML  
- Logs are stored locally and exported as JSON for review or backend upload  
- Time intervals, cooldowns, and thresholds can be customized per exam policy  
- Gaze tracking is experimental; accuracy depends on lighting, camera quality  
- DevTools detection is basic; advanced techniques can be added  
- Review security and privacy compliance before deploying in production  
- This setup can be extended for remote online exams with added server-side verification  

üí° Use this as a foundation to build a robust AI-powered online exam proctoring system.
